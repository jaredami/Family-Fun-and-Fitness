            <p class="widget-text hideme">I am dedicated to helping others get motivated, get stronger, and simply improve their overall health. Fitness can be so fun and exciting when you find something you truly love to do. I love helping people find that! I studied Physical Education and Health at Purdue University for 4 1/2 years and am also certified in Bokwa. I currently teach Cardio Scuplt and Burn, Stretch Strengthen and Tone, Spin, and Boxing throughout the week. Now that all three of my kids are in school, I’m back in the profession that I love! I’m so excited to share the knowledge I have been storing up and help people change their lives and overall wellness.</p>

            <p class="widget-text hideme">As a mother of two, with a third on the way, health and fitness are an important part of me and my families lives. I believe that staying active is amazing for increased energy, and an overall sense of well being and happiness. I have been playing sports since a young age, but threw myself into the fitness world two years ago. I know the challenges of balancing home and work life while trying to fit in gym time. I, too, have struggled with weight loss after babies, and I want to share my experiences to help others on their journey. My goal as a trainer and instructor is to positively motivate you to get moving and most importantly, keep coming back. Along with being an NPC Competitor, I have been an ACE Certified Personal Trainer, as well as a Certified Silver Sneakers Instructor since October 2013. I currently teach Bootcamp, Circuit, Body Sculpt, Boxing, and Silver Sneakers. I look forward to motivating you!</p>
